# YogaBodyTracker

A lifestyle app which uses a cosinus earable device to track heart rate and body temperature while doing yoga.

## Disclaimer

The app uses the FlutterBlue package so any device with an android version of >10 is not supported.
Even though FlutterBluePlus supports newer versions of android, it is unable to receive some of the sensor data like heart rate and body temperature reliably.
This is the reason why FlutterBlue was chosen instead as it can connect and provide the sensor data of the cosinus device without the above mentioned issues.


## Getting started

To use the app you need the following:
- Cosinus one earable
- Smartphone with Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) functionality
- Android version <= 10 (API-Level 29)

If the 3 criteria mentioned above are met, then you should be able to use the app without any issues.

Have fun exercising!
